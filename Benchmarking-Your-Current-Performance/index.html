    <h2 id="1">Gaming Performance Benchmark</h2>
    <p>
      To assess your game's current performance, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch the game you wish to benchmark.</li>
      <li>Check if the game has a built-in FPS counter in its settings or options. If not, you can use third-party software like MSI Afterburner or FRAPS.</li>
      <li>Play the game for approximately 10-15 minutes while monitoring the FPS counter.</li>
      <li>Take note of the average FPS and any noticeable lag or stuttering during gameplay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="2">System Boot Time Measurement</h2>
    <p>
      The time it takes for your PC to boot up is an essential metric. To measure it accurately:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Restart your PC.</li>
      <li>Use a stopwatch or a smartphone timer app to record the boot process's duration.</li>
      <li>Note down the time taken for your PC to fully boot into the desktop.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="3">Application Load Time Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Application load times can significantly impact your day-to-day experience. To measure them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch the application or game you want to benchmark.</li>
      <li>Time how long it takes for the application to load and be ready for use.</li>
      <li>Record the application load time.</li>
    </ul>
