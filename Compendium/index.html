    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FPS (Frames Per Second):</strong> The number of frames or images displayed per second in a game or application. Higher FPS usually results in smoother visuals and better gaming experiences. A higher FPS ensures that fast-paced action is rendered smoothly and improves your overall gameplay experience.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>SSD (Solid-State Drive):</strong> A storage device that uses flash memory to store data. SSDs are faster and more reliable than traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Using an SSD significantly reduces loading times in games and applications, resulting in quicker responsiveness and a more seamless user experience.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Overclocking:</strong> Increasing the clock speeds of your CPU or GPU beyond their default settings to achieve better performance. Overclocking can lead to higher temperatures and may void warranties if not done correctly. Overclocking is beneficial for enthusiasts who want to extract more performance from their hardware but requires careful monitoring to prevent overheating or instability.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Registry:</strong> A database in Windows that stores configuration settings for the operating system, drivers, and applications. The registry can accumulate unnecessary entries over time, leading to performance degradation. Optimizing or cleaning the registry can help improve system performance and responsiveness.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Latency:</strong> The time it takes for data to travel from one point to another, often experienced in different aspects of computing:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Network Latency:</strong> The delay in data transmission between your computer and a server. Lower network latency is crucial for online gaming to reduce delays and lag. Lower latency means less delay in receiving data from game servers, resulting in smoother and more responsive gameplay.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Render Latency:</strong> The time it takes for your graphics card to render and display a frame on your screen. Lower render latency leads to smoother visuals and reduced input delay. Lower render latency reduces the time it takes for your GPU to process and display graphics, resulting in a more immersive and enjoyable gaming experience.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Click-to-Action Latency:</strong> The delay between clicking a button or performing an action and seeing the corresponding result on your screen. Lower click-to-action latency is important for responsive gameplay. A lower click-to-action latency ensures that your actions are immediately translated into the game, making your interactions with the game feel more natural and accurate.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Ping:</strong> A network utility that measures the round-trip time for data to travel from your computer to a server and back. Lower ping values indicate reduced network latency. A lower ping is crucial for online gaming as it reduces the time it takes for data to travel between your computer and game servers, resulting in a more stable and lag-free gaming experience.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> The system that translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand. Optimizing your DNS settings can lead to faster and more reliable internet connections, reducing loading times for websites and online games.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):</strong> The component responsible for rendering graphics and images on your computer screen. A powerful GPU is essential for running graphically demanding games and applications at high settings and resolutions, delivering stunning visuals and smooth gameplay.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Driver:</strong> Software that enables communication between your operating system and hardware devices like graphics cards, printers, and network adapters. Up-to-date drivers ensure compatibility, stability, and optimal performance for your hardware components.</li>
    </ul>
